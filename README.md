# OLD EUPHORIA README
Euphoria is a site dedicated to creating, editing, and playing text adventures
collaboratively. Euphoria is not a MUD, but multiplayer world exploration and
editing is planned. Euphoria is sort of a game, but it is more of a game
community.

## Goals
- classic text adventure gameplay with an easy to use editor
- collaborative editing and exploration
- Heroku compatible
- mobile support
- modern game features such as achievements, user profiles, and chat

## Inspired by
- classic interactive fiction games, especially [Zork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork)
- [Glitch](http://www.glitchthegame.com/)
- [Parchment](https://code.google.com/p/parchment/)
